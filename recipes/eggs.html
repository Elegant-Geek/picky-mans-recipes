    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is the first thing I learned to cook because I was feeling ambitious with it.
    <br>JMU definitely makes them better than I ever could. Go Dukes.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3-4 eggs</li>
        <li>Pepper if you're not boring</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack each egg against a fork into a bowl. Remove shell pieces that fall in as you go.</li>
        <li>Mix the eggs well with the fork until it is runny.</li>
        <li>Pour mix into a pan (stove set to medium/high heat)</li>
        <li>As the mix becomes more solid, bunch it together to make a smaller patty.</li>
        <li>Once the bottom is solid (or a bit brown), flip the egg patty.</li>
        <li>Wait for the other side to cook. Press the "wet" areas into the pan with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Once the patty is solid and well cooked on both sides, you can either chop it up 
            <br>into bite sized pieces or into a smaller "scrambled" mess. </li>
        <li>Remove eggs from the pan and put onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Cool people throw on copious amounts of pepper before eating.</li>
    </ol>
