README File:
This project is my first Odin Project website showcased on GitHub featuring the three easy things I know how to cook.
The project showcases:
    Navigation between multiple pages
    Relative links (possibly some absolute links)
    Bold and italicized text
    Other basic elements like anchors, line breaks, paragraphs, headers, and images
    Raw/basic HTML, no CSS
